# tos-ts README

This is a quick and dirty syntax highlighter for the thinkScript language used by the [Think or Swim](https://www.tdameritrade.com/tools-and-platforms/thinkorswim/desktop.page) trading platform provided by [TD Ameritrade](https://www.tdameritrade.com/home.page).

If you wish to extend this with more features please feel free to [open a pr](https://github.com/jmbeekman/vsc-thinkscript-extension)  (though you'll probably need to dm me on Discord [`Yetzederixx#4364`] to merge/deploy).

## Usage

* Install
  * [VSC Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LethalArts.tos-ts)
  * Follow the [VSC Quickstart](vsc-extension-quickstart.md) directions after cloning for a direct install.
* Start a new file with a `.tosts` extension and code.
